My final project is an MP3 player app called myTunes
It plays MP3 files and supports many of the same features as commercial programs, like toggle play/pause, toggle mute, and playback time
tracking using threads.

The filepath of every song played is saved in songs.txt and used for keeping track of the user's library

Many of the features I described in my proposal were slightly ambitious, like displaying the metadata in the library list, however I
feel like I have learned a lot about GUI programming using python.

I consulted many resources to create this project, most notable are StackOverflow, the python and tkinter documentation,
and the YouTube channel buildwithpython
